# Theodore W. Sturtevant
### September 28, 1961 - March 24, 2020

Theodore "Ted" William Sturtevant (58) of South Lyon, MI formerly of Glastonbury, CT and Morristown, NJ passed away on March 24, 2020 following a year-long battle with cancer. Born on September 28, 1961 in Morristown, NJ, Ted was the son of Robert Sturtevant and the late Connie Petack Sturtevant.

He is survived by his son Logan Sturtevant (22) of South Lyon and his extended family in both Michigan and Pennsylvania. Ted grew up as an only child but spent many happy summers with his maternal grandparents Lucille & Louis Petack and cousins in Wilcox, Pennsylvania.

Ted spent his career as an Engineer of Information Systems for Munich Re remotely in MI, but, as they say, you can take the boy out of Jersey, you can't take the Jersey out of the boy. His true passion was tossing pizza and making friends as the owner and operator of his food truck, Teddy's Pizza. There were few things he loved more than cooking for his friends and loved ones. One of those things was the smell of the ocean. The waves called to him and he visited as often as he could to savor the seafood and special times with his family. Ted was also a sports aficionado and enjoyed watching games and sharing stats with his son. He enjoyed playing fantasy football, visiting his friends at the VFW, and fishing. His beloved dogs Bella and Jamie will certainly miss his presence. Ted was always the brightest smile and most boisterous laugh in any room. He will be missed by all who knew and loved him. Ted will be laid to rest in South Lyon Cemetery.
